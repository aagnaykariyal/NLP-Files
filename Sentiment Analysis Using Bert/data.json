Decided to sit on that one, but during various research (lots of opinions out there on whether the ML or SH is \"better\", including a lot from people who have both), and also just general reading on forums here, Steve Hoffman, Vinyl Engine snd Audio Karma among others, I kept reading about how the AT-VM95C is actually a great stylus despite its low price (and being conical). So I hopped on Amazon to pick one up, and when I did, I saw that the VM95SH I'd had in my saved cart had temporarily dropped to a hair over $160 vs. the normal $200.

And honestly, I still love to experience music this way. \n\nMy reasons for getting into vinyl are entirely different. For a few albums that mean a lot to me, I mainly want to display their artwork at a decent size. \n\nBut the other main factor is that I wanted to deliberately take time to listen to music. Having everything at a few click's distance no matter what I'm doing has been detrimental to that. \n\nSelecting a record, carefully taking it out of its sleeve and placing it on the spindle, picking up the tonearm and placing the stylus in the run-in groove, then sitting down and really listening to the music... that's what I really like about vinyl.\n\nYou mentioned the culture that exists around selecting and buying (used or new) records - that's been great, too. In general, it all feels more appreciative of the music than dealing with ephemeral digital information.\n\nFinally, I had been using technology as a crutch when DJing for a while, and wanted to force myself to actually learn the craft... vinyl has been a game-changer.

It is spectacular at first, but not necessarily more enjoyable long term.\n\nNot to take away anything from folks with super high end systems that are really enjoying their records more than with less expensive/revealing equipment.  That is a the point, so awesome for those folks.  It just did not work that way for some of us.", "No matter what. Audiophile aspirations aside, it absolutely SUCKS to get a record that sounds like shit. Like there is a level of quality that records should meet that many do not right now. I think quality control is at an all time low right now. The industry needs to get it together. A record that sounds like shit is basically worthless.", "So I\u2019m going to start off saying that I generally agree with you. Chasing the best audio quality is a losing game, it can be very expensive, and it can get in the way of enjoyment of the hobby. There\u2019s always a better version, always a better condition copy, always a new gadget to clean your records, always a turntable upgrade\u2026 all of the above.\n\nThat being said, you mainly refer to \u201ccrackles and pops\u201d as the primary measure of sound quality. To me, crackles and pops aren't an indicator of the sound quality of a record - they are an indicator of the condition. When most people refer to sound quality, they are referring to the mastering.\n\nPersonally, I separate albums into two camps - before the mid-90's, and after the mid-90's.  Generally speaking, anything after the mid-90's is the \"digital era\" where recordings were not done with an analog medium like vinyl in mind.  With some exceptions, chasing better sound quality on vinyl from this era isn't worth it.  These albums can still sound amazing, but the differences between vinyl and digital will be much smaller.\n\nBut, for albums from the 60's/70's/early 80's, vinyl was the primary medium.  For the late 80's/early 90's, a lot of albums were still recorded analog.  This is where you will find much wider variety across different vinyl pressings, and in many cases, records sounding much better than the CD or digital counterpart.  This is why people often chase original pressings vs. modern reissues - because, by default, the mastering was optimized for vinyl.  And, even though this doesn't hold true every time, in the vast majority of cases, this means more dynamic range.\n\nAs an example of what better dynamic range sounds like, check out the 4:20 mark of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1YyVYIXlTo).  Two very distinct sounds between the two records.  In the first, you'll hear a lot more space between the instruments, and each instrument is distinct.  In the second, the instruments blend together a bit more and it's more of a \"wall of sound.\"  That's compression in a nutshell.  To be fair, if you're listening on headphones or computer speakers at moderate volume, the 2nd may sound more appealing - and that's why compressed recordings started to become more popular, because they sound better on smaller or lower quality speakers.  But if you were to play each record loud through a quality stereo, the 1st will blow the 2nd away.  The 1st will sound like the band is in the room, vs. the 2nd will sound like a recording.  That, in a nutshell, is why people chase high quality vinyl.\n\nFor the record (pun intended), both of the records in this video are reissues - but one was done all analog specifically for high sound quality on vinyl, vs. the other was sourced from digital.\n\nAll that being said, I still will go back to my original statement that I agree with you - not everyone has the budget or desire to chase sound quality.  Record collecting is still a blast if you completely ignore everything I said above.  However, if you REALLY get into record collecting, I would encourage you to keep an open mind - because once you find that amazing sound, you'll never go back.", "Vinyl collecting is a novelty. Which is why so many enjoy it.", "I\u2019ve been collecting music for over 50 years.  My collection is 60% vinyl and 40% CD.  You can\u2019t own digital streaming and I\u2019m not aware of the ability to stream complete albums.  I agree that CD and digital is more convenient but it is lacking so many good releases from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s.  You don\u2019t have to spend thousands to get excellent sound from vinyl.  My advice is always start with a quality turntable/cartridge that tracks at 2 grams or less.  That way you\u2019re assured of maintaining the quality of your albums as you improve your system.", "If I wanted audio quality I'd listen to CDs", "It\u2019s the experience.  Audio quality is lost when you send it to the mastering house & into production, for any medium.", "As long as people stay away from cruisers and cruiser clones I'm completely fine.", "This is why i need the entire KUSHFACE / FIENDWORLD discography pressed. \n\nSame with DJ SMOKEY\n\nSame with ATIVAN CORERA\n\nSame with LOUD LORD\n\nThe lost goes on and on...\n\nBLANK BODY...\n\nThere are so many artists and waves I've discovered just through soundcloud in the last 10 or so years that im deadass anxiety ridden about losing some of that music to the digital void. It's a trippy thought, but for me. It goes back to wanting something physical. \n\nInspiring post, sorry for the rant!!", "Conversely, getting fantastic audio is precisely what drives me. The big thing is that I'm not insane, I know what the limits are, and I know that I can't achieve the absolute best, but I can get pretty fucking good easily and I'm happy with that.", "And variants", "I was an elitist when I first started collecting 15+ years ago. Over the years learned to not give a fuck. I\u2019ve moved a dozen times, lived with roommates dogs and cats all over the place, had good turntables and shitty ones. \n\nI just love collecting. But I mainly listen to Spotify on my cheap Amazon headphones. Sure, I\u2019ll throw on a record now and again, but discovering music is so much easier with streaming. Once I know an album is worthy of owning on vinyl, the chase is on.", "I never caught the audio bug, spent all my money on music instead. I scraped together something tolerable to play on, always 2nd hand or hand-me-downs. I bought a new amplifier when my old one broke down a couple of years ago, and a new record player. Even I knew it was shit. \nWhen I hear music I like, it works for me the same, wether it's played on a high-end stereo or a shitty transistor radio", "My ears are not good enough for me to care about a \"perfect sound\" anyway", "I've hot a reasonable turntable , amp and speakers I just enjoy listening to my records .I don't even put them in order ,last record played goes to the front .old habit I suppose .", "I had to scroll back twice to check that I had read you were 18. Very fine writing. You capture the sentiment so well. Continue to express yourself. You have \u201cit\u201d.", "Agree. A record has to sound really really bad for me to not enjoy it. \n\nAnd further, the endlessly chasing superior audio quality to my mind is really someone trying to chase the feeling he/she got when they first heard or used to listen to Steely Dan or whatever on the radio in the garage. There is no re-capture of that. You can spend all the money you want on your setup and you will not be satisfied.", "Completely agree. The appeal of vinyl is that it encapsulates the history of the time in which the record was recorded; the cracks and \"dusty\" sound add to that. Additionally, vinyls are such a key part of history that if we don't keep them in the mix we are losing such a major part of music as a whole. I'm very happy that vinyl sales have been stable throughout the past few generations and I hope they remain a part of releases in years to come. I do hope that the printing of vinyls becomes more accessible to smaller artists (our band has been considering printing a limited number of vinyls for our upcoming album) I'd be curious to see how that changes the market tbh", "Thanks for this. I kind of needed to read this post.\n\nI just got into the hobby and my first set up was to pair my LP60XBT to my Home Theater soundbar through the Bluetooth.\n\nHowever, when playing some Vinyl I realize that some part of the song became really flat and the bass was completely gone. It wasn't a really nice experience.\n\nWent out the next day and got myself a pair of Edifier R1700BTs. No more drop in bass but I felt that the overall quality is still not as good as I hope, so I have a pre-amp, and also looking to add a small subwoofer. \n\nBut I will stop there. Going further down would be thousands of $ spent on speakers. I would rather spend that money on new Vinyl.", "Agreed. I never collected vinyl for the audio quality. I mean I don\u2019t want my records to be noisy, but it\u2019s about much more than that - as you said so well", "If I wanted perfect quality, I would\u2019ve never gotten into records. I like them become I like to physically own the music I love and the idea of a needle on a wax disc producing music is wild.", "100% this. One of my biggest reasons to buy vinyl is all the awesome art on the dust jackets and whatnot. Can\u2019t get that anywhere else.", "Not to mention the fact that vinyl is *objectively* inferior for audio quality and fidelity than the formats that have come since. If audiophile quality is your end goal, stick to streaming services that offer 96kHz/24-bit and higher. We\u2019re literally scraping a piece of plastic with a tiny little metal stick and listening to the vibrations. That\u2019s hardly an arena for perfect audio to exist.", "10000000000% in agreement. I work from home and I like records because they get me out of my seat but other than that if I\u2019m doing focused work I prefer Spotify for something to play continuously for background noise.

I have upgraded my system many times over the years by replacing the weak links in my system with better used equipment. Only new equipment I invested in was a turn table.

But once I got an above average system it has become an obsession. Once I heard that near mint pressing of an original copy of Warren Zevon\u2019s Excitable Boy through my vintage Technics receiver going through my JBL L-150a\u2019s I was hooked on finding the best sounding records.", "*\"I\u2019m not aware of the ability to stream complete albums.\"*\n\nThere are multiple streaming services through which you can stream complete albums (Spotify being one of them).", "You just pick an album to listen to on Spotify....", "Completely understand and agree, having physical backups of our media is always important, not just from my own preference for consuming the music I like, but also to preserve what we have in the worst case scenarios. I personally feel like we're putting too much trust in corporations and allowing them to have full control over distribution of both music and film - just look at these streaming services which have a ton of shows and films that haven't been copied into a physical format, and look how they've just disappeared because the streaming service has decided to take them off of their catalogues.\n\nLike you said, so many small artists don't have the power to have their music made into a physical format because its not deemed financially beneficial to the studio or publishing company. I'm scared for modern hip hop as it stands, even though I basically don't listen to any of it - its so reliant on a digital format that if corporations go bankrupt or wipe content from their archives, it's gone forever. Of course this goes for pretty much all music being released nowadays, but a lot of modern rock bands (who are at least larger) get records produced because there's a target audience for it.\n\nBut I should probably stop typing so much now, I'm glad that you find my thoughts relatable!", "It is like a sport, for example running. If you really needed to get there quick, you\u2019d take the car. \n\nIf you wanted a perfect photo, you would use a camera and not canvas and oil paint. \n\nThere are some rules: The music is on a vinyl disc. You will read it via a stylus while maintaining proper speed. Now make the most of it! Not rational, but that is often the case for hobbies :-)", "Yup! \n\nControversial to say here, but vinyl does not sound better than mp3, or CD. Chasing perfect audio fidelity via a flawed medium (don't get me wrong, I LOVE vinyl) is a fool's game.", "I'd say speakers are way more important for sound than turntable, as long as you have a competent turntable. A $200 turntable with $1000 speakers will sound way better than a $1000 turntable with $200 speakers.", "This. 90% of the people in this subReddit have never even heard a $2,000 system much less anything considered audiophile quality. They'd very quickly change their tune if they did.", "There are a lot of reasons to support digital as a technically superior format\u2026certainly more practical, and definitely a superior recording medium, but it\u2019s hard to say, in absolute terms, that one format is \u201cbetter\u201d. In the end, it is all about the source material and mastering choices. With modern music that is digitally recorded, vinyl is a hard sell (for audio quality) but many older recordings do not have a good digital release. When you are considering some of the older stuff that I am into - 60's/70's garage, psyche, prog, krautrock, etc. \u2013 the master tapes are long gone and their digital releases are often just rips of existing vinyl records. These can sound very good, but many do not. They typically prioritize the reduction of surface noise, so they are heavily de-noised, dull sounding digital transfers - made even worse by aggressive digital limiting to ramp up the loudness and questionable EQ choices. This is where the desire to get original pressings is a valid pursuit.\n\nI\u2019ve done a lot of audio-nerding and done A/B\u2019ing of analog vs. digital and it is actually kind of fascinating and really shows the wide variety of sound quality due to mastering between releases.", "Good vinyl should generally sound better than mp3 as thats a compressed file type, maybe you meant lossless files like wav or flac?", "Somehow it\u2019s super controversial. I get downvoted every time I bring it up. I\u2019m not saying people shouldn\u2019t enjoy the hobby however they want, even if that includes going the audiophile route. I just don\u2019t like people spreading the misconception that vinyl is somehow *pure* and *superior* from a sound quality perspective. It just isn\u2019t. But that\u2019s okay.", "Exactly. I will replace records that I already have with better sounding pressings. Took me three tries to finally get that Zevon record to my liking. It gets expensive, but since I gave up alcohol eight years ago the only thing I spend my fun money on is records and seltzer.", "Yes exactly.  \nVinyl is not \u201csuperior sounding\u201d, it\u2019s a different format and in my opinion a superior *experience* to other mediums.  \nIt\u2019s 100% personal preference when it comes to sound though- for example analog recordings recorded for the format sound a certain way when playing on the equipment it was intended for.  \nThe digital remasters sound crystal clear, but I really love something like Master Of Reality by Black Sabbath on vinyl.  \nIt\u2019s sludgy heaviness suits vinyl imo, despite it sounding lovely on a CD it\u2019s just a bit too clean.", "Yep. Whenever I'm out and looking at records, I always use Discogs or Steve Hoffman forums to check user comments on pressings. There are such marked differences in quality between pressings.\n\nHah. And yeah. I used to be a hard living bartender and once I stopped spending all my money on drinking, constantly eating out, and Ubers every night, my bank account swelled and I was able to afford a pretty decent system after a couple of years.

Sure you will.\n\nMr Remorseful. \"I bought this record the other day and it's not the mix I thought it was, can I have my money back?\" He spent half an hour checking it out on the listening post. He's probably burned it to CDr.\n\nThe Chatterbox. Comes in for a nice long chinwag every day. Haven't you got a home to go to?\n\nMr Tedious. Likes to bore on about pressings, mixes, matrix numbers, records he has at home, the value of his precious discs. Zzzzzz.\n\nThe drug addict. Speeding his tits off.

How fucking entitled can you get?\n\nAnd it's not like we're playing experimental harsh noise, a lot of the time it's relatively accessible music but it's just not familiar so the olds hate it.\n\nThat's my biggest pet peeve but I also hate it when customers pick up records and put them down in random spots.

It is really difficult to help people find Elton John when you left it in Rod Stewart's tab.... Also same with CDs. We have it where it should be obvious what direction they go in but somehow so many people still jam them in the wrong direction even though it requires force and effort to do so... \n3. Leaning forward. Always leaning forward. Everything leaning forward. \n4. Complaining we're playing Taylor Swift or god forbid new music friday. \n5. PLEASE. CUT DOWN. THE MUSK. The store is inside a bigger building so our small area doesn't always dissipate the smells as well. You're gagging me. \n6. My most personal peeve is the guy who never buys anything, comes in, complains how anyone would buy any of this shit when you can just pirate it, and acts like he's gods gift to mankind...but keeps coming back. and acting just as arrogant. I pity the special education students he apparently works with... \n7. We feel more excited when someone actually reads our signs and does what is requested vs. just doing what they want. I know it is annoying. But we have those rules there because sadly someone broke the needle off the tester table and didn't tell us. Someone damaged the cover of an expensive record. People kept opening them to check the condition then never put them back in a sleeve. We aren't accusing you of being the problem - we're preventing other problem people.\n8. You asked us to order something for you and then never picked it up. We made a new rule for people to pre-pay. We had people who prepaid NEVER PICK THEM UP. DUDE YOU PAID $80 AND JUST...DIDN'T COME? \n9. I understand you may be stretched for time, but the new arrivals rack is the new rack for a reason. These things just came in. Embrace the newness. They are not alphabetical. \n10. No, we actually do not have a catalog of every single thing in the store because things go in and out so quickly that it'd be nearly impossible to keep up. We can give you a direction and even assist you in finding it, but please don't get MAD or RUDE with us because we can't recall if we have Dazz Band still when it has sat here for over a year. \n11. We are not giving you $500 for a use vintage turntable that only sells for $110 even on ebay. You can get mad and act like we are crooks all day long. Can't help your attitude. \n12. I am sure you totally played this record that looks like it was drug behind a car and is warped to hell and totally confirmed to my face as if I am dumb that it \"plays fine\".

I don\u2019t get upset or anything, I understand they\u2019re speaking from a place of emotion, it\u2019s just my personal pet peeve. Finding stacks of records carelessly tossed in a garage or basement and left for a year or longer gathering heavy amounts of dirt, dust, pet hair, and moisture that kills the album jackets always crushes me inside.\n\nAlso, buying records that REEK of cigarette smoke.

This guy came in, walked around, kept trying to talk to me and asked me if he could use the bathroom. He had his hair in a ponytail and asked me if I recognized him. I said no and tried continuing to work. He took his hair down and claimed he was the singer from Kingdom Come. I don't know if he was or not, but I didn't give a sh\\*t. He eventually left on foot. Weird.\n7. We had this guy, whom I called Lobster Hand Man, who used to come into the store, and rarely bought anything. He was annoying and rude. One day a customer had wanted to hear a particular CD so I was playing it for that customer. Lobster Hand Man yells out, \"What is this *shit* you're playing?\" I told him a customer requested it. He kept quiet after that.\n8. Some people who came in were really annoying.

An owner/manager can make a policy like that and hang up signs. Which would alienate many of your customers, for no good reason.

With the ground lifters the plugs stick out too far from the outlet to fit an outlet box over them.\n\nSo far I've come up with the following solutions:\n\n1. iFi ground defenders for both subs ($99 each... too expensive)\n2. DIY some sub cables w/ 90 degree plugs (should reduce the \"stick-out\" enough that I can use an outlet box over the ground lifters)\n3. Make a larger outlet cover (I'm a SLOW woodworker and this project would take forever with aforementioned 9-mo old)\n4. Wireless transmitter for subs (too expensive, adds more clutter to my minimal system)\n\nAny other obvious solutions out there? Are there any outlets out there that are configured to eliminate this sort of issue.\n\nSince this issue is due to the ground, can I simply disconnect and cap the ground cable at that one outlet?", "Where is my weak link and where would you spend $700 to improve my set up?\n\nI am curious to hear folks opinions on what the weak link(s) in my set up is and how they would spend ~$700 to improve it.

Secondly, I have seen dozens of reports that the JBL 305P's have an awful hissing issue when listening in near-field. I believe I understand this can be an issue with many Class-D Amps in near-field but have not seen the problem reported (as numerously and as awfully) as with the JBL's which is what is causing me to lean towards the MTM-100s.\n\nThe MTM-100s are gimmickly priced at $400-$500 \"normally\" but are nearly always on sale at $238. This price leads me to believe they'd be better than the JBLs potentially but I see so many raving reviews over the JBLs as if they're the gold standard for entry-level high-quality speakers.  Granted, I have yet to see a bad review about the MTM-100s and it seems as if they'd be a sure-fire buy as well.\n\nSo, which is it? Option 1, 2, or 3? Is the hissing on the JBL really that bad in near-field? Which speaker is better, the JBL, or MTM (or NEUMI lol).

I think the best workaround or compromise in your setup is to get speakers which are either meant to be placed horizontally (so laying flat) by design or at least claim to sound fine even when laid on the sides.\n\nIf you want to stay within the price range of the Edifier R1280T, then you could look into these:\n\n[PreSonus Eris 3.5BT 2nd Gen](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/PreSonus-Eris-3-5BT-Gen-Multimedia/dp/B0CC3SC6QZ/?th=1)\n\nFor reasons unknown to me, [PreSonus claims that some of their monitors can be placed horizontally.](https://pae-web.presonusmusic.com/downloads/products/pdf/Brief_Tutorial_On_Studio_Monitors_07022019.pdf) They simply recommend you have the tweeters towards the outer sides (as illustrated on page 6).\n\nBut because doing so undeniably causes some issues in acoustics, I highly recommend getting [angled stands like these](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/S2/dp/B00X16SBU6/?th=1) to compensate for a lot of those.\n\n[Here's my professional illustration of how that will look like in your setup.](https://i.imgur.com/1HGoPWg.jpeg)", "Hello, I see you've already received some suggestions on your post in /r/StereoAdvice, but I would like to offer you the opportunity to get some personal advice and recommendations from me - specifically for the Swiss audio market, as I'm also Swiss and have a lot of experience with what is especially cost-effective for us.\n\nOne possible setup I put together with two local products (speakers and DAC), for example.\n\nSpeakers:\n\n* [Swiss HD Solo 3](https://www.stereotec.ch/swiss-hd-solo-3-lautsprecher/solo-3.25)\n\nAnalog integrated amplifier:\n\n* [Rega Elex-R](https://hdzuerisee.ch/p/rega-elex-r-ab-lager)\n\nSeparate DAC:\n\n* [Merason fr\u00e9rot](https://www.audio-markt.de/market/merason-frerot-3209561805)\n\nCD player:\n\n* [Yamaha CD-S303](https://www.mueller-spring.ch/cd-player-sacd-player/yamaha-cd-s303-schwarz)\n\nNetwork streamer:\n\n* [WiiM Mini](https://kraske.ch/shop/wiim-mini-kompakter-streamer/)\n\nThis setup would come to a total of around 4845 CHF. This leaves some leftover budget to account for interconnect and speaker cables.\n\nAnother setup which is **extremely** cost-effective by making use of local deals and maximizes sound quality.\n\nActive speakers:\n\n* [Piega Premium Wireless 701](https://tonbildspinnerei.ch/produkt/piega-premium-wireless-701/)\n\nSeparate DAC:\n\n* [Merason fr\u00e9rot](https://www.audio-markt.de/market/merason-frerot-3209561805)\n\nCD/local file player:\n\n* [Shanling ET3](https://www.k55.ch/zubehor/streaming-multiroom/shanling-et3-streamer-mit-cd-player.html)\n\nThese add up to 4985 CHF, adding the cost of two interconnect cables brings it to just about 5000.-\n\nPrice-to-performance ratio is through the roof with this system, as the Piega Premium Wireless 701 active speakers are **vastly** superior to the Swiss HD Solo 3 (and pretty much any other speakers at this price) in sound quality.\n\nIn addition, the Shanling ET3 is one of the very best CD transports available for the money and also doubles as a local file player from a network via DLNA streaming or from an attached USB drive.\n\nBut if you would rather have a more classically styled CD transport with included remote, replace the Shanling ET3 with the [audiolab 7000CDT](https://www.mueller-spring.ch/hifi/cd-player-sacd-player/audiolab-7000cdt-silver) instead.\n\nLet me know if you like the systems I showcased or would like some more specific advice.", "Schiit Gjallarhorn is a speaker amp, so that\u2019s not what you need.

You would do so by getting a [3.5mm AUX to stereo RCA cable](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Adapter-Subwoofer-Gold-Plated/dp/B01D5H8JW0/) and first connecting the 3.5mm AUX jack to the A07 Pro's LINE OUT 3.5mm socket.\n\nThen connect the left (white) RCA jack to the UNBALANCED INPUT RCA socket of the Outlaw amp that will power the left speaker and the right (red) RCA jack to the one that will power the right speaker.\n\nThis would be how you get everything running with just the Outlaw monoblock amps and what you already have. I don't think they're overkill for your KEF Q150 speakers, but they are so nice that I think it would be a shame to not pair them with a higher quality preamp.\n\nHere are some analog or digital preamps I think would pair well with the Outlaws:\n\n* [Schiit Saga S](https://www.schiit.com/products/saga-s) \\- an analog solid state preamp with remote control\n* [Schiit Saga+](https://www.schiit.com/products/saga-2) \\- an analog tube-hybrid preamp, if you want to try out something tube-based\n* [Bluesound NODE](https://www.amazon.ca/Bluesound-Wireless-Multi-Room-Hi-Res-Streamer/dp/B0937LC7P2?th=1) \\- a digital streaming preamp with built-in DAC and subwoofer output\n* [Yamaha WXC-50](https://www.amazon.ca/Yamaha-WXC50-Component-Preamplifier-Silver/dp/B0711BMPWY/) \\- a solid alternative to the Bluesound NODE, has slightly more inputs/outputs\n\nThe NODE and WXC-50 are particularly attractive in my opinion, because they would give your system access to streaming services and Bluetooth as digital input options.\n\nBoth of these also have 12V trigger outputs, which you could use to send a wake-on trigger signal to the two Outlaw amps whenever you power the preamps on, so everything always turns on at the same time.\n\nLastly, the Bluesound NODE specifically has very good subwoofer management features through its accompanying BluOS Controller app, such as an adjustable low-pass filter for the sub and high-pass filters for the main speakers (this is a rare and **very good** feature to have!), etc...", "Don't panic, I'm fairly confident in this and doubt that your Technics amp is completely shot!\n\nGiven its age, it's very likely that it was simply some capacitor or fuse blowing from old age + wear & tear. The fact the amp still turns on and isn't smoking or anything funky like that is a good sign, at least.\n\nWhat I recommend you do is to bring your Technics amplifier to a local electronics repair shop and have them open up the case to look at the circuit boards and check for faulty or broken parts. If it's only some caps or fuses that need to be replaced, then they should easily be able to do that for you at a relatively low cost.\n\nYou could theoretically even do such simple repairs yourself, but that would still require some basic knowledge and experience with electronics as well as equipment like a multimeter and a soldering iron.\n\n/r/ElectronicsRepair could give you some advice if you went that route and posted some pictures of the amp's innards on there for them to look at.\n\nBut I think bringing the amp to some professionals for them to look at is the easiest way to get it fixed.\n\nGood luck!", "Hey there, unfortunately we're not particularly knowledgable on home theater setups and AV receivers.\n\nI recommend you ask over on /r/hometheater, they're the best place for questions on this subject.", "Hi!

If you had a studio subwoofer instead, then integrating that would be a lot easier.\n\nLike the [Yamaha HS8S](https://www.thomannmusic.com/yamaha_hs_8s.htm) for example, pretty much all studio subs have TRS/XLR inputs as well as outputs for the main monitors.

I went through a few lower to medium end turntables and ended up getting that exact same one. Been happy with it since.", "speakers have iso pads underneath, and the receiver is never used over 30%, and stays very cool while in use. :)", "Thanks! they\u2019re running PC>Pioneer as soon as I can find a cable to aux that fits in the RCA ports on the receiver. I guess they\u2019re much closer on the older machines as there was less insulation on the plugs", "Nice! I am going to my first set up for office so I\u2019m intrigued. Do you have PC audio go through that amp?", "First setup since highschool", "Also, I\u2019m about $170 into this setup including parts for refurbishment", "The AR turntable is the real gem - these have skyrocketed in price, alongside the renewed interest in vinyl.\n\nIf you change the belt and keep everything in stock condition, you'll have a turntable that'll give excellent performance, and probably last for another 50 years. Match it up with a vintage or modern high-compliance phono cartridge, and it'll be on par with any belt-drive below $1K.", "That's nice\n\n/s sack the jazz though put on some slayer", "I refurbished a Madison Fields version of that amp. It had dead output transformers, and it looks like yours has had one replaced too!", "Yes, I got it an an incredible value. It works great as is , the belt was stored separately . I\u2019ll be getting a new belt soon, and will perform general maintenance despite its functionality soon.", "I run heavier stuff too. Earth, bardo pond , growing , calm \u2026 not slayer though", "What model is the Madison fields version? Just found out about it ! How do you like yours ? How would you describe how it sounds . Yes I did notice the transformer had been swapped .. but not by me", "Sounds great - you're really going to enjoy it.\n\nBe careful not to lose the tonearm bearing if you remove the spindle to oil it - this has happened to me at least twice!", "I love bardo pond and earth are great, will check those other two bands", "Thanks for the advice :)"]}
