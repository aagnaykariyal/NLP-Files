{"Sentences":"The one is offering an AT LP120 with a good condition since he says he rarely used it for 247 USD (bought it in 2019).","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The other one is an Technics SL1200 MK2 with a quite good condition, everything working properly and its body seems still okay to look at, for about 318 USD.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The question is, as someone really new Im really interested with the MK2 knowing the reputation it had but kinda worry about its maintenance since its an vintage product.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Tbh, sound quality is quite matters to me but Im ready to tone down since my ear havent reach that \"audiophile-level\" and as a beginner I havent ready to spend too much money for an equipment.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"- If i use a cheap speaker (ex: Edifier 980T) is it going to lower down the quality that the Technics?","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"I need help: I bought a used Audio Technica LP120 and I connected it to my Mastersounds Radius 2 mixer, the result is a electrical screeching which seems to have something to do with the cartridge\/tonearm (I tried 3 different carts and two headshells, only the Ortofon DJ MK2 seems to be less of a problem which I presume has something to do with it having a closed chase).","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I think it has something to do with ground, since the noise gets less when I touch the tonearm.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Audio Quality of a vinyl a lot of times isn't about the medium, turn table, cart, etc, it's about the MASTERING that was done for big records back in the day.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Vinyl records were mastered for large speakers powered by big amps, so you have much higher dynamic range and minimal compression.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Digital music is MASTERED for headphones and lower power speakers, and modern vinyl records are just that same digital mastering pressed on wax.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"9 times out of 10 you hear someone talk about \"classic album XYZ is SO much better on vinyl\" it's about the MASTERING, not bit depth\/sample rate\/medium.","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"For a few albums that mean a lot to me, I mainly want to display their artwork at a decent size.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"But the other main factor is that I wanted to deliberately take time to listen to music.","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"Selecting a record, carefully taking it out of its sleeve and placing it on the spindle, picking up the tonearm and placing the stylus in the run-in groove, then sitting down and really listening to the music... that's what I really like about vinyl.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"You mentioned the culture that exists around selecting and buying (used or new) records - that's been great, too.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"In general, it all feels more appreciative of the music than dealing with ephemeral digital information.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Finally, I had been using technology as a crutch when DJing for a while, and wanted to force myself to actually learn the craft... vinyl has been a game-changer.","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"The industry needs to get it together.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"A record that sounds like shit is basically worthless.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"So I\u2019m going to start off saying that I generally agree with you.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Chasing the best audio quality is a losing game, it can be very expensive, and it can get in the way of enjoyment of the hobby.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"There\u2019s always a better version, always a better condition copy, always a new gadget to clean your records, always a turntable upgrade\u2026 all of the above.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"That being said, you mainly refer to \u201ccrackles and pops\u201d as the primary measure of sound quality.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"To me, crackles and pops aren't an indicator of the sound quality of a record - they are an indicator of the condition.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"When most people refer to sound quality, they are referring to the mastering.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Personally, I separate albums into two camps - before the mid-90's, and after the mid-90's.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Generally speaking, anything after the mid-90's is the \"digital era\" where recordings were not done with an analog medium like vinyl in mind.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"With some exceptions, chasing better sound quality on vinyl from this era isn't worth it.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"These albums can still sound amazing, but the differences between vinyl and digital will be much smaller.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"But, for albums from the 60's\/70's\/early 80's, vinyl was the primary medium.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"For the late 80's\/early 90's, a lot of albums were still recorded analog.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"This is where you will find much wider variety across different vinyl pressings, and in many cases, records sounding much better than the CD or digital counterpart.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"This is why people often chase original pressings vs. modern reissues - because, by default, the mastering was optimized for vinyl.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"And, even though this doesn't hold true every time, in the vast majority of cases, this means more dynamic range.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"As an example of what better dynamic range sounds like, check out the 4:20 mark of [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s1YyVYIXlTo).","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Two very distinct sounds between the two records.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"In the first, you'll hear a lot more space between the instruments, and each instrument is distinct.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"In the second, the instruments blend together a bit more and it's more of a \"wall of sound.\"","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"That's compression in a nutshell.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"To be fair, if you're listening on headphones or computer speakers at moderate volume, the 2nd may sound more appealing - and that's why compressed recordings started to become more popular, because they sound better on smaller or lower quality speakers.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"But if you were to play each record loud through a quality stereo, the 1st will blow the 2nd away.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The 1st will sound like the band is in the room, vs. the 2nd will sound like a recording.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"That, in a nutshell, is why people chase high quality vinyl.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"For the record (pun intended), both of the records in this video are reissues - but one was done all analog specifically for high sound quality on vinyl, vs. the other was sourced from digital.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"All that being said, I still will go back to my original statement that I agree with you - not everyone has the budget or desire to chase sound quality.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Record collecting is still a blast if you completely ignore everything I said above.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"However, if you REALLY get into record collecting, I would encourage you to keep an open mind - because once you find that amazing sound, you'll never go back.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Vinyl collecting is a novelty.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Which is why so many enjoy it.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019ve been collecting music for over 50 years.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"I agree that CD and digital is more convenient but it is lacking so many good releases from the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You don\u2019t have to spend thousands to get excellent sound from vinyl.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"My advice is always start with a quality turntable\/cartridge that tracks at 2 grams or less.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"That way you\u2019re assured of maintaining the quality of your albums as you improve your system.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"If I wanted audio quality I'd listen to CDs","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"It\u2019s 100% personal preference when it comes to sound though- for example analog recordings recorded for the format sound a certain way when playing on the equipment it was intended for.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Harden My Heart is one of my all time favourite songs!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"That was one of my favorite albums at the time.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"All the time.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Especially if it's something from another country, even more especially if it's japanese.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"One of my favorite finds at a local store was some albums by Mikami Kan. Like it's hard to not by an album that looks like [this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_RpKdKB-VAY) and [this](https:\/\/www.discogs.com\/release\/1589244-%E4%B8%89%E4%B8%8A%E5%AF%9B-1972-%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B4%E9%9B%B6%E7%8B%90%E5%BE%92) , It's not my style of music really but damn do I love the cover art by Toshio Saeki.","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"!","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"All the time.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Have found quite a few gems that way.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"That's a good album.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Harden my Heart is a great track and a hit in its day.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I have definitely done that but I came here excited because I literally was just playing a Quarterflash record yesterday and wondered why no one seems to remember or appreciate them.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Mad props for bring up a (Quater)flash from the past.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"To the question, absolutely not.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"But Harden My Heart is a classic.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Wow, this album is good!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I was curious, so I threw it on spotify.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Now, I will be scouring my local record stores for it.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I especially like \"Critical Times\" and \"Valerie.\"","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Thank you for this!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I actually have bought some gems.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I found a Dolly Parton album with an alternate version of the hit song on it.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I also found a stereo copy of a Cher album I thought was only available in mono.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I found a promo copy of an Abba album that sounded better than standard copies.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Too funny, just picked that up recently as well!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Great driving song!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Same hear.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Some real duds.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I have used some of them as record dividers.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Works great","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I agree.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Such great stuff in the $1 bins.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Too bad I already have most of it.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"Great unique music!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Nice!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019ll have to keep my eyes open for that!","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Love Phil Collins !","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Such unrealized potential.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"But that\u2019s the way the music industry rolled back then.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"That cover is so cool!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I Like \ud83d\udc4d","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Random rotation.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019m really getting into it!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Love the sax!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Bet it was great!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"And the cover is very cool","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"How cool is that.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019ve been playing some 80\u2019s albums today that have that 80\u2019s sound with a great saxophone player.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I was just playing Martha and The Muffins, Echo Beach.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You ever hear that song?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"\ud83d\ude0a","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Should try it sometime.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If you are lucky you will discover some great music , if not you are out a buck\u2026..","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"You are so welcome!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"This album is so under appreciated!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"It is crazy how much great music was released in the 80\u2019s .","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Excellent!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"It's an amazing album beginning to end.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I didn't know the story of that release until recently: he was being held from releasing his first solo album due to label\/contract issues with Steelers Wheel, which maybe gave him even more time to put together what became an iconic album.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Nice one!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Oh that's a good idea.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Some of the real bad ones I just returned to the freebie bin at the store lol.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Label dropped them in 85, pretty ruthless","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I actually never heard of Martha and the Muffins!","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I'll have to check them out now.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":":) I love finding something new and since it is in that vein maybe I'll enjoy it too!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Another fun fact - the US LP (of City to City) was mastered at the incorrect speed.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Since the CD also includes this error, the US safety copy tape was probably the culprit.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Just picked it up and I am just discovering it.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"So far so good!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Check it out on YouTube, Toronto band from the early 80\u2019s , echo beach  is SO GOOD!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Interesting.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"How does it play, fast or slow?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"There are several posts in the Hoffman forum that say it starts out sharp\/fast a gets faster toward the end.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The album runs long, so it was probably done to make the sides an easier fit.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I grew up with Baker Street playing on US radio and was surprised when I heard my first correct mastering.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"When you stream it via tidal - is that then the correct master?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Record store owners\/workers of \/r\/vinyl, what is your biggest pet peeve with customers?","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"No, the $1 bin is not alphabetical.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"No, I don't know if we still have that $5 Police record you saw two months ago.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Yes, I may be 34 but I have indeed heard of Todd Rundgren.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"No, I didn't order the splatter version of your favorite obscure band just for shits and gigs.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"No, you can't return this used record from three months ago.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"No, I can't drive two states over to look at your \"eclectic mix of 70s records\".","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"No, I don't listen to every record in the store.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"People seem to be way more obsessive over \"surface noise\" these days.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Had a customer return basically every third record for extremely minor issues on used records.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Not every record is meant to be played on a midlife crisis soundsystem to bring you back to the time of  your first kiss.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"\u201cI\u2019ve got this really rare Elvis record!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"It\u2019s blue.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I know it\u2019s a collector\u2019s item and worth a lot of money.\u201d","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Former worker in a record store here, that sold new vinyl and CDs only.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"My pet peeve was people buying new vinyl then returning it in a state which showed they\u2019d not taken care of the record at all - finger marks mostly.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Often wanting a refund not a replacement.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Always the same people as well.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The non-customers who come in for pictures of themselves for Instagram.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"I worked in record shops for 20 years or so.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Here's a few of the more problematic features of some customers\n\nThe Messer.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Likes to throw records around, puts them back in the wrong place, upside down, creases covers etc.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"The Carpet Bagger.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Comes in every few days and looks for the one record in the shop that's under-priced.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"He wants a \u00a3100 record for \u00a31.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Well, we all do, don't we?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"One bloke kept it up for years, in every few days, never bought anything.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Bus stop Man.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Comes in at 5.55pm to while away the time until his bus comes.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I've been in since 9am and want to go to the pub.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Jog on bus stop man.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The Saver.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Sure you will pal.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Sure you will.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Mr Remorseful.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"\"I bought this record the other day and it's not the mix I thought it was, can I have my money back?\"","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"He spent half an hour checking it out on the listening post.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"He's probably burned it to CDr.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The Chatterbox.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Comes in for a nice long chinwag every day.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Haven't you got a home to go to?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Mr Tedious.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Zzzzzz.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The drug addict.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Speeding his tits off.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"Piles up the records, disappears outside for a quick top up and then comes back to annoy us some more.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Can get violent if you argue with him.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Add to that - shoplifters, burglars selling stolen good and general timewasters.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I used to work at a Tower Records in the late 90s and there was a not uncommon problem of people shitting on the floor or jerking off so it sounds like despite the gas bags and the cranks, the speciality stores of today are an improvement.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I've spoken to a few record store owners and I can say one of them is people calling to hold a record for them and then calling back three days later to say never mind.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I would say my pet peeve with record store owners is pricing and condition.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I realize an owner can't check the condition of every record in the store but if you're charging the full price listed on discogs & the record has scratches maybe you should not charge the full price.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Used to work in a record store.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Here are the top five most annoying customers.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"5.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Those who demand long musical discussions every single time they come in, like chatting at me is part of the service I provide.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"4.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Anyone who brings their noisy kids and then ignores them as they treat the store like a playground.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"3.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Shoppers who freely fart up the store.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"You know other people have functioning noses, right?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"2.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Thieves.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"1.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"People who hit on and make lewd comments about my female coworkers.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"People saying \u201crecords are really coming back aren\u2019t they?\u201d One, of course I know that, I work in a record store!","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Two, some dummy says it every day.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Three, this definitely signifies they are just some time waster who doesn\u2019t even buy records and thus won\u2019t be spending anything.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Same thing with people who want to come in and go on about how they used to have every record ever but got rid of them.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Heard this 10,000 times, it\u2019s getting a little tedious.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"It also probably means they aren\u2019t going to buy anything, which means they are another time thief.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"The worst of these are the people clearly drunk or high who want to really impress you with their tales of huge record collections they have.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Once again, huge time wasters who aren\u2019t going to buy anything.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"And may scare away real customers!","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Resellers who think they are being sneaky.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"They come in like clockwork every week, look at every single item and only buy something they think they can Jack the price up on.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If I have something like Hendrix in the bargain bin because it\u2019s scratched, they\u2019ll be sure to get it and try to rip off some kid for $20.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I actually don\u2019t give a shit as long as someone pays the price I\u2019m asking, I just kind of roll my eyes that they think I don\u2019t know","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"People that complain about the music we're playing.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"It's always people between the ages of 55-75 and the complaint is usually along the lines of \"my generation's music was better than this\".","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"If you want to listen to classic rock radio shit all day, that's fine, but I'm going to play stuff that I think is cool and that I want other people to know about.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I also couldn't imagine walking into any store or restaurant and complaining to the employees about the music they're playing.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"How fucking entitled can you get?","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"And it's not like we're playing experimental harsh noise, a lot of the time it's relatively accessible music but it's just not familiar so the olds hate it.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"That's my biggest pet peeve but I also hate it when customers pick up records and put them down in random spots.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"You have no idea how bad it fucks us up.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Hunting down missing records is a huge and irritating waste of time.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"If you decide you don't want something but forgot where it came from, just give it to a clerk, we'll refile it.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"-people bringing in moldy\/unplayable\/worthless records and getting angry that I won't buy them.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"-people stashing records in random places \n-people calling in and asking if we have a million different things.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I'm happy to help look for a few things, but please come in and shop for yourself.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"And I'm not gonna shit on someone for having a cheap turntable, but this time of year we get a LOT of people complaining that a record they bought from us is skipping, and without fail they have a suitcase player that's causing the issue (I always test them out on our store player and surprise surprise it doesn't skip...)","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"There are some great ones on here.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"One that I didn\u2019t see is when someone comes in looking for something, either for themselves or as a gift for someone else, and just stares at you with a blank stare like you\u2019re supposed to read their minds.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"For example I had a lady come in a couple weeks ago and she walked up and said \u201cI\u2019m looking for uhhh\u201d for no less than 10 minutes because she couldn\u2019t remember the artist or even a song to help me find what she wanted.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Also drives me crazy when people get upset over the prices for rare or obscure records.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I had a lady that came in around the same time as the other looking for something rare Beatles related for her son and she got upset when anything rare or rarer in really nice shape was more than 20 bucks.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I own a record store and the only thing that bugs me is people asking for discounts.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"None of the other stuff that bothers everyone else bothers me.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I'm actually shocked by people complaining about their customers talking to them.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Why else would you get involved in retail ownership?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Most of the things listed are standard practice in a shop and have been for years and years, so if these things bug you, maybe owning a record store isn't the right choice for you.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"\"I'm surrounded by records and I don't hate it yet\" is my mantra and when the day comes that I do, I'll be out of the business.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"People who don\u2019t lean the bins back.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Or just put records wherever they feel like.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Our hip hop and soundtrack bins are constantly a mess because people just\u2026 can\u2019t put things back where they found them.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"If you\u2019re not sure, bring it to me!","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"People who are wearing headphones has been bothering me lately for some reason.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I cannot begin to tell you the number of old men that have told me their divorce stories and as many older folks in general who \u201cwish they hadn\u2019t gotten rid of their records\u201d.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I get it, I just hear it every day.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"People who are loud and shout across the store to their spouse\/friends.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Be respectful of the other people shopping.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The other customers don\u2019t need to hear your conversation.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Also\u2026 never, ever comment negatively on the music we\u2019re playing.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"It\u2019s not yours to choose.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019m not gonna make negative comments on what you bring to the counter.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Edit: I thought of more.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I like to talk to you, generally.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"But I likely have no interest in your collection unless you want to sell it to the store.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Most of the time it just comes across as humble bragging.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019m not going to tell you about mine unless you ask and even then, I\u2019m still probably not.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Also, boomers.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Please stop telling me about your old setup\/collection.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"The amount of times we\u2019ve had a record on the wall because it\u2019s rare and had a boomer or gen x\u2019er go \u201cwow, so that\u2019s what that\u2019s going for these days?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I used to have it.\u201d Or \u201cI have that one.\u201d You probably don\u2019t.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"In fact I\u2019m 100% you didn\u2019t have MoFi Dylan in the sixties\/seventies.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Customers looking records up on eBay\/amazon.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If you want to try to eBay your Herb Alpert Whipped Cream and Other Delights for $100, go for it.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"But in our store it\u2019s $5 and I\u2019m giving you $2.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"We\u2019re there for a reason.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"It\u2019s what we do.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Damn this thread is fun!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019ll be interested to see how this pans out, as I have lots of pet peeves with vinyl shop owners and unrealistic pricing based on Incorrect grading of stock.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"These guys need to wake up and stop asking \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 for discs they mark as VG+ that are barely playable and I end up just giving to charity shops.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I won\u2019t sell on records i think are below a genuine VG.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I recently paid \u00a314 for a copy of steely dans countdown to ecstasy.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"He wanted \u00a317 for it but I pointed out a few marks and he said ok, but they\u2019d probably clean out.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Got it home, and put it through the cleaner, and it\u2019s just covered in permanent rub marks, groove damage and hairlines.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"It probably shouldn\u2019t even have been for sale imho.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"But we also have lots of very genuine sellers with great quality stock, so it\u2019s a mixed bag!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Probably the one thing that tops my list is bored middle aged white men that seem to think im here to listen to their any thought.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"And they have the audacity to think that I somehow agree with their often racist, homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic ideas.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"The idiot that takes records out of the protective sleeve and then puts them back in with the outer sleeve opening to the side.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"You can see every record they did this to as you tumb through the bin.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Also, putting the inner sleeve into the jacket sideways so the record can fall out.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Thats fine if you want to do that to yours at home but not in a record store.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Leaving the record stacks leaning forward.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The hip hop section is notorious for this as hip hop fans tend to be of the younger generation who are careless assholes.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Do not mess the store up, a lot of us sell online, some of us sell way more online than in store and we need to find those records in order to sell them, you are not a child, you know where you took that from, put it back or give it to us, I can guarantee you 99% of clerks won't have a problem putting your unwanted stuff back because we'll put it in the right place where we can find it.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"&#x200B;\n\nCome to the store to shit on new music\/new records, \" I don't buy nothing beyond the mid eighties\" This is a real quote of a guy who came in to touch all our stuff, scoff and complain.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"At this point you are unaware of your smell because you live and play in your own dirty litter box, but the rest can smell you, oh boy we can and this is the thing, your friends and loved ones missed that window of opportunity to tell you and now it is awkward so they have decided to just avoid you and let you continue your quest of letting a BO imprint like the shadow of a nuclear blast victim everywhere you go.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"&#x200B;\n\nThe other extreme, people, really, stop showering with perfume\/cologne at this point you should know you spray once or twice in the air, walk through it and sashay away bitch.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"&#x200B;\n\nCustomers online, I couldn't care less if this record is important and you need it shipped now, the rest of the customers waiting for their orders to be processed online are equally as important as you and your lack of planning is not theirs or my fault.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"What I'm buying  is almost exclusively newer stuff.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I absolutely want to hear something I haven't heard before when I go to a record store.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"> Also drives me crazy when people get upset over the prices for rare or obscure records.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I know for me, it's because I was there, I held them in my hands, when the records were new and $6 sealed, and I passed on it because my job paid $3.40 an hour.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I don't get upset, especially against the staff, but I mentally kick myself that I passed them up, or I sold it for pennies when I was downsizing a few years ago.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"The headphones one is interesting to me.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I never hope to come across as disrespectful in the store, but sometimes I rather listen to my own stuff than what the shop is playing (ties in to your last point.)","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Even you don't know why it bothers you, \"for some reason.\"","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I always take some earbuds when I go to record stores.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Because if I see a cool looking album cover of a band I've never heard, and want to check them out, it's easier than using the listening station.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Plus, not all record stores in my area have listening stations.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Plus, you don't have to clean your equipment after I use it.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Because I'm using my own instead.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Sometimes I come across an album by a band I like but not too familiar with the particular album.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Again, listening to said album is much easier with my own gear.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Furthermore, having earbuds in ensures that I'm not going to talk your ear off about anything.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I'm minding my own business, using my own things, that I'm legally allowed to use.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If it bothers you that much, make a \"No Headphones\/Earbuds\" policy for your store.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"An owner\/manager can make a policy like that and hang up signs.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Which would alienate many of your customers, for no good reason.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I just think it comes off as unwarranted spitefulness.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Lastly, I personally always make sure my earbuds aren't loud enough that it would bother others.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"This is the only reason I can think of that may be annoying to others.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"Generally I\u2019m looking up albums I don\u2019t know much about to see if it\u2019s something I want to buy.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I bring my headphones because I don't want to appraise the albums with the $20 Technics junk hanging off the Store record players.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Any record store that sells below VG records above bargain bin prices (except rare records) is a bad store.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"Honestly make sense, makes it easier to check the records for condition without having to pull everything out.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Of course I have to turn those around when I get home.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I know the records I buy from there because they have sideways price stickers.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"* If I can buy a used record from multiple sellers online for less than you are charging, then what's the point of me making the effort to come to your store (unless it's a $$$ grail)?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Especially when you're a shop that has 10k+ used records and hardly any room in bins to bring out anything recently acquired.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Move your inventory so people have a reason to want to come back in on regular basis and see what's new.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"* Don't charge 2021 prices in 2024 on used records.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You're eating your own tail.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"If you want your business to survive long term, read the room and work on making the hobby as financially accessible as possible for your customers w\/o fucking over your staff's wages.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You'll move a lot more product and collectors will be loyal to your shop when you're not just pegging everyone a mark for a quick buck.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Regarding 3 (and sometimes 4); at one shop I went to for many years (has since closed \u2639\ufe0f) I got to know the two owners since I was there at least once a week.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If one or both were there when I 3as buying stuff, they would always give me a discount - and if an employee was ringing me up and the owner\/s saw they'd tell them to give me a discount.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Sometimes one or both owners would be in the store but not notice I was checking out.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I would never even *think* of trying to get the owners attention or telling the employee that they give me a discount or a better value if I'm selling \/ trading in (nor would I if the owners were not in the shop).","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"Ok this is where I have to gripe.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Record store employees complain that customers talk to them and they don\u2019t want to be talked to because they\u2019re working (I understand that).","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"But now you\u2019re saying customers who come in and silently browse and purchase a record or 3.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"So which are customers supposed to do?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Tell me you've never worked in a record store without telling me  you've never worked in a record store.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"6 ohm speakers are fine with just about any audio amplifier you\u2019ll find currently on the consumer market.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Sometimes speakers have unique plugs.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If yours don\u2019t have that, they should be fine.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You could just get a really simple amplifier like an Aiyima A07.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Nothing much to it, just inputs and outputs and a volume control.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"When Audioengine speakers require an amp they clearly describe them as passive speakers, like this - [Passive speakers](https:\/\/audioengine.com\/shop\/passivespeakers\/p4-passive-speakers\/).","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If you want to pair your computer with Bluetooth speakers and set that as your default audio output, I don\u2019t know that you really need a wired connection.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The wire seems like it should technically sound better, but Bluetooth probably sounds fine.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"USB might sound best.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Gotcha, yeah that's totally fair.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Something that does come to mind now would be to replace the SMSL SU-8's digital preamp with a solid, fully separate analog preamp.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Not that the SU-8's preamp performance is bad or anything, but I do think this could bring an audible improvement to your system.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Especially since the Zu speakers are very responsive to changes in upstream components due to their high sensitivity and impedance.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I've heard very good things about the [Schiit Freya+ tube preamp](https:\/\/www.schiit.com\/products\/freya-n) for example, if you don't mind buying a second-hand one to stay under $700.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The [Schiit Lyr](https:\/\/www.schiit.com\/products\/lyr) or [Schiit Kara](https:\/\/www.schiit.com\/products\/kara) would be quite good too.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Or you could of course go for a well-kept vintage tuner\/preamplifier to match your power amps.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I am not sure how much difference between the two headphones you should expect to hear.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Look up some reviews?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"All of the speakers you've listed are good options, though I don't know that the Denton's are within your budget.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The Dali Oberon 1 and 3 are within your budget.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Well Amazon luckily is relatively easy and hassle-free when it comes to returns.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"And you might be lucky and either not mind the hiss or get units which aren't particularly bad (if there is unit variance for this).","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I actually don't know how much exactly is covered in the free consultations as I didn't need any.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"But simulating and calculating room acoustics is very possible if you give them accurate room layouts, dimensions and properties.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"That even goes for in-room response of speakers, provided there are sufficient measurements and data of the speaker available.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"But yes, there will obviously be limits to how much they can advise you through a call x)\n\nEdit: Come to think of it, they do advocate for using a calibrated UMIK-1 measurement mic with Room EQ Wizard to do basic acoustic measurements of your room ([see their YouTube vid on it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tLUClxjUTC4)).","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I imagine they would ask you to do so and send them the measurements for them to formulate specific advice for your room.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You're welcome!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The Schiit Mani 2 and the Rega Fono MM MK3 perform about the same, so you can honestly go with whichever one you like.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Yes, your current phono preamp is quite special because it has an analog to digital converter built-in.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"While convenient, it also means that it can easily be improved upon in both phono preamp signal quality and analog to digital conversion quality.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"If we take its US list price of about $200 as reference, then you can think of it as having bought a $100 phono preamp and $100 analog to digital converter together in one unit.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"By going with separate components almost double the cost of that, so the Schiit\/Rega phono preamp and either the Topping or MOTU audio interface, you will definitely achieve better audio quality when ripping vinyls.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I don't think it's going to be twice as good as the cost might suggest, but on paper it's definitely an upgrade.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I looked up that Audio-Technica cartridge and it does seem like a worthwhile upgrade too.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Something like this - [Pro-Ject Pre Box Digital](https:\/\/www.project-audio.com\/en\/product\/pre-box-s2-digital-edition-23\/)","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You're welcome.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"It would be great if that's how it worked, but unfortunately, choosing the BluOS app means you have to stick with Bluesound's speakers and streamers\/amps.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The same goes for the other brands, who each have their own app and supported hardware.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You will have to deal with a proprietary, closed eco-system AKA \"walled garden\" in every case.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"There are other solutions which would allow you to mix and match components more freely, but those involve a lot more knowledge, planning and effort to set up (stuff folks on \/r\/homeautomation come up with, I imagine).","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Edit: Actually, I suppose you can keep it relatively simple by employing multiple WiiM [streamers](https:\/\/www.wiimhome.com\/wiimmini\/overview)\/[amps](https:\/\/www.wiimhome.com\/wiimamp\/overview).","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You would simply need any kind of active speaker that you can connect a WiiM Mini\/Pro each to.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Bluetooth is popular because so many devices commonly used with amplifiers have Bluetooth.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I can connect my iPad to my mini amp to play music through my speakers, for instance (it\u2019s great).","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"You can also connect a Bluetooth-compatible turntable to the amplifier.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You're welcome!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"That StackExchange thread is talking about AC power cables, the regular type of power cable for common household electronics etc.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"What they said in that thread therefore doesn't really apply to speaker wires\/cables, as those are built differently (more simple in fact) compared to regular AC power cables.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"For reference, there are some people who use speaker wires that consist of just a single copper strand in their setups, without any problems at all.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The electric loads speaker wires carry are so minuscule compared to what AC power cables can carry, that there's almost no way for them to be a threat or cause damage.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"But if you don't feel comfortable with the way you stripped your current speaker cables, then by all means replace them with more cleanly stripped ones.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Nothing wrong with playing it safe!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I can recommend looking up how others strip their speaker wire, [as shown in this basic video guide for example](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RMJ_q0zJjU4) or [as demonstrated by cheapaudioman in his video on this subject.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Going like this will work just fine:\n\nTurntable > Schiit Mani 2 > Aiyima preamp outs > Outlaw mono amps > KEF speakers","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"No worries, I'm glad to help out!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Japanese hifi products from back then are known to be very well-built and can easily last for over a lifetime.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"You just have to give them some proper care and love every now and then; this one too will gladly sing sweet tunes for you again once it got a bit of touching up at the shop :)\n\nDefinitely keep me posted, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you that it'll be a quick fix \ud83e\udd1e","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I see.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"So, while many amps nowadays have dedicated sub outs, that doesn't mean older amps without them can't output a signal for active subs at all.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"As long as the amp has any kind of line or preamp outputs, you can simply run a [mono RCA cable](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/BlueRigger-Shielded-Subwoofer-Plated-Connectors\/dp\/B008UGPBXM\/?th=1) (which are also sold as \"subwoofer cable\") from any of those RCA sockets, doesn't matter if you take the left or right one.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Sometimes you can even use a regular stereo RCA cable, when the sub has stereo RCA inputs.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Most modern, active subwoofers will be able to function with a signal transmitted that way, as all the settings you might need to adjust are usually located on the sub's back plate.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"[Here's a great guide going over the basics of subwoofer connections.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"](https:\/\/www.lifewire.com\/connect-a-subwoofer-to-receiver-or-amp-3135132)","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I see, that's unfortunate.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I would go for the S360DB then, they should work better in a nearfield setup than the R2850DB which are quite large.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"You're welcome!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I'm personally not very experienced with Apple devices and iOS\/macOS, but it seems [there are ways to retrieve such files](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/docs\/DOC-10141), even without syncing in iTunes.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"These options leave you enough budget for a pretty nice Fluance turntable if you don\u2019t see anything you like on the used market.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"A sub should *not* usually be centered.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"The best location is often in a corner to one side of the main speakers.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"A sub could help because it has its own amplifier that can provide far more power than the STR-DH190.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"That\u2019s something a passive speaker like a tower cannot do.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"The 3rd speaker would interfere with the soundstage effect of stereo, there\u2019s another drawback.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"And then there is the technical issue of how to connect the 3rd speaker.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I think you would have to combine left and right to mono before connecting it to the speaker.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Volume comes largely from power.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The STR-DH190 doesn\u2019t have a lot.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Maybe you could look into larger main speakers.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The way the physics of a speaker works is the larger speaker requires less power, not more.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"So I think those are your options - More power, subwoofer, larger main speakers with higher sensitivity.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You\u2019ve almost got the right idea, but that 3rd speaker really ought to be a powered sub.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"What would you suggest?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Or don't use the Fulla at all","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to grab those kef lsx\u2019s they seem like to good of a deal to pass up honestly","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Well the new ones were 600 dollars and don't even work without an amp so I feel like my expectations were appropriate lol \n\nI also do have hearing loss so I'm sure that has something to do with it","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Thank you!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"As far as upgrades go in the future, are there any brands I should keep my eyes peeled for\u2014good customer service, repairability, etc.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I do like the look of this set up more with the WiiM.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I will have to find what will connect.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"but then it sounds bad!","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"\ud83d\ude29 why bother using a turntable at all if the sound is going to be compressed to hell before it gets amplified?","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"Oh okie dokie thanks very much I really was unsure because I do want to get a bigger amp, with more speaker terminals, also I\u2019m not to sure my active sun will be able to do the signal transmitter because it\u2019s also a early 90s one, think 93 it came out but yes thanks for your time some useful info.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Oh sorry I should have said, the iPod is long dead.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I like that plan.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"One day I my get some better speakers but I think this will be good for the moment.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Thank you so much for the explanation.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Now to turn my attention to learning about powered subs!","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"So, in a setup in which I am only running a turntable and potentially a CD player (no AV\/surround sound considerations) does the power from the amp in the receiver or the power from the amp in the powered subwoofer determine the power\/impedance requirements for the speakers I run?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Or does the power from the subwoofer essentially mean it's just not drawing any power from the receiver?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I know the receiver I have does not have a dedicated subwoofer output, if that matters.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"(I thought speakers would be my first upgrade, but maybe I should consider the receiver first.)","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"And again, thanks so much for your time.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I am not technically minded at all, so the learning curve has been a bit steep.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019d probably go ahead and connect the speakers to the Fulla preamp output.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Turn up the speaker volume pretty high and then adjust it down with the Fulla.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You're welcome.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"New passive speakers aren't something you really need to worry much about.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Any of the brands mentioned would be excellent choices.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Ideally, the active speakers would have digital optical TOSLINK inputs.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"But simple 3.5mm AUX or stereo RCA inputs will also work fine.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I used Bluetooth speakers with my turntable before and the music still seemed much better than normal computer audio quality.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Ah, I see.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I assume you already tried [force resetting your iPod?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/102293)\n\nI'm seeing some guides using recovery software to pull files from iPods, but that'll only work if your PC still recognizes the iPod as an external device\/drive when connected.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If it's dead dead, then I'm afraid you're out of luck, because the data itself is encrypted (with the key located in the processor of the device) and wouldn't be readable even if you physically extracted it from the SSD storage.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"The powered subwoofer doesn\u2019t draw power from the receiver.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"It can be ignored for impedance purposes, even if it is connected to the speaker outputs of the receiver.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"So if you choose a subwoofer like an SVS SB-1000 Pro which has speaker level inputs, you can to connect those in parallel like this - [image](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/kS4N66M\/IMG-0687.jpg) - with no effect on impedance.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The best 2-channel system for the money is mostly a combination of the speakers and the room acoustics, so I wouldn\u2019t suggest upgrading the receiver first.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019d save it for last, but choose speakers with the idea that a better amplifier is eventually coming.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Thank you!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Would you recommend any other dac or fulla Is good?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Also for the size of the speakers are those good?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"It's for movies, gaming, and music","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Is there anyway of only having a single Wiim device to control speakers throughout the house?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Or is multiple needed?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Again, just want to sincerely thank you for your time and advice.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Will be going with an active sub for my first upgrade.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"There\u2019s no need for a DAC upgrade.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"What would help your system most is probably a subwoofer to fill out the frequencies below the range of your speaker.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"It could be a small, inexpensive sub.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"It doesn\u2019t need home theater levels of power.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Negative, you'll have to make every speaker \"smart\" by adding a WiiM streamer, so they can all communicate with the central control device or network.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You\u2019re quite welcome.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"It\u2019s nice to be able to help.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I will be doing that , what could I use for a volume knob?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Ohhh okay I understand it now, thank you.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I assume every speaker needs to be hard wired into the Wiim mini for it to work with it?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"There are volume-controlled outputs on the back of the main speaker.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Use that for the subwoofer and its volume will be controlled along with the speakers.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Exactly, that's what I referred to with my previous previous comment.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The best way to connect the WiiM Mini would be via a digital optical TOSLINK cable, if the speaker has a corresponding input for that.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Otherwise, connecting it via a 3.5mm AUX\/3.5mm AUX to stereo RCA cable will work fine as well.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I wanted to have something in front me of I can change at my finger tips not turn the speaker around each time","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Okay thank you so much, I now understand, I was thinking of it working a whole different way but this works for me.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The sub being connected to the speakers means it will be controlled by the Fulla, since the speakers are connected to the Fulla.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The sub volume follows the speakers, even if the knob you\u2019re turning is the Fulla.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Right now I don't have a sub just the speakers would you still suggest fulla or something else","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If you have the Fulla now, I\u2019d say use it.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"If you don\u2019t already have it, an Epos GSX 300 does a similar thing for half the cost.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Not that it\u2019s my first choice, though.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Just an example of a DAC with volume control.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"What would be your top 3 choices","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I have the GSX 300 and am happy with it.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"GSX 1000 would probably be good.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Fulla would make the list.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Technology has progressed.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The new KLH seem like an expensive money grab to cash in on the vintage craze to me, are they even good?","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"> In January 2017, Kelley Global Brands bought the company and renamed it KLH Audio.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Looks like the Model 5 are about $2500?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You could buy incredible speakers and a system with $2500 in vintage gear.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"For sure, we keep what sounds best and forget the rest","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Depending on what you like you may can modify the others to sound similar.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Sometimes something different will at first blush seem better.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Give it some time, play different music.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"OTOH maybe you prefer that ribbon tweeter.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Now that being said, the KLH got a ton of influencer hype when they were introduced.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"They are now getting deeply discounted.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"HMMM?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":" I have a pair of Martin Logan Motion 40's, and I'm not surprised you like them.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I bought them after hearing a friend's Motion 20's and being surprised how good the SQ was.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The Motion series offered a very high value IME.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"My whole surround sound setup I\u2019ve had for 10 years is motion series.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Love it.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I would love to have two towers instead of bookshelf\u2019s for the front L\/R but at this point the next time I buy a speaker it\u2019ll be to upgrade the whole setup.","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"You are clearly chasing s\/t important.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Many years ago I bought the speakers that I always wanted.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"An opportunity came for me to purchase another set to use on a second system, and I hooked them up to my main system and was floored.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Sold the 1st set the next week, and kept the 2nd set for 40 years.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"And be sure to listen to them after switching their positions.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Sounds like you haven't looked back since.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Deeper lows are one of the biggest factors.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"The Model 5s don't have the bass response of the ported Martin Logans.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"This gives them a fuller sound to my ear with hard-hitting rock songs and rap, etc.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Vocals tend to be a bit more forward and have more clarity as well.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Haha!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Solid.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"They're both box speakers.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Almost all home hi fi speakers are box speakers.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Elongating and narrowing a box does not change the fact that it is still a box.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Technology in manufacturing, materials, measurement and DSP have allowed for tighter tolerances, higher power handling and wider frequency response from modern drivers.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Crossover designs have smoothed the transition and reduced phase and distortion interactions between drivers.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Being able to model cabinets and drivers have allowed for fewer errors for the same number of trials.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"That 12-18\" may be making a pretty big difference.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"My local shop let me audition the KLH Fives for a weekend.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I thought they lacked oomph.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"What do you think the MLs do better?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Nope, not at all.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"In fact, I plan to get more ML stuff for my future surround sound setup, which will start with getting myself the 30i center speaker and also getting a good ass AV receiver.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Have you thought about pairing the KLH\u2019s with a subwoofer to help out the bass factor?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Interesting.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I would have guessed the ML\u2019s would be a bit brighter and crisp (and perhaps they are).","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I went with a different \u201cmodern vintage\u201d choice (wharfedale lintons) and that\u2019s one thing I find myself missing - sometimes the vocals feel like they\u2019re subdued a little, or behind the rest of the instruments, and I would like them to be a *little* more forward and bright.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019m talking about the style, not the technical design.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Those wide baffle 70\u2019s speakers had a lot of crap qualities, not just dictated by the fact that it is a box.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Those boxes were very poorly damped, for one.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Ha, I own BMR Towers.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"They are such deep immersion speakers that completely disappear.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I have.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I was looking at a KEF K62.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Due to the small apartment living.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I paired my Lintons with a digital Technics integrated amp, and it actually restored some of the brightness and detail that I was missing.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"When paired with my Marantz, they were a little too \u201cwarm.\u201d","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"One thing that I dislike about my MA6300 Integrated amp is that there are no tone adjustments.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"So what I get is what I get out of it.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Opposed to my Marantz 2230 which the Model 5s sounded great on.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"But the Marantz has tone adjustments.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The bezel shape at the front of the cabinet where the grill cloth attaches is very different between the original Model 5 from the 60s and 70s and the Model 5 reissue from a few years ago.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"OP's speakers are very clearly a modern product, made with modern techniques.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Poor damping and resonances are not inherent to that particular cabinet shape.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Besides, how exactly are larger woofer sizes supposed to be used if not with wide baffles?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019m using a Yamaha as-1200.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I may try some different combinations and see.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019ve noticed a lot of it has to do with certain sources or recordings.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":">Besides, how exactly are larger woofer sizes supposed to be used if not with wide baffles?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Vaguely pyramid-shaped speakers like the ESS AMT-1A, Thiel CS-2, or Wilson Sabrina?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Bizarro-world speakers like the OHM Walsh or Dahlquest DQ-10?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Or, you know:  YOLO those baffle diffraction issues like the JBL 4350?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"All kidding aside, baffle size does make a difference that can be predicted, measured, and heard.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"But that's just one aspect of a sea of other (also important) considerations that come into play with loudspeaker design.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"IDK that it matters enough to be a primary focus.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I also have Lintons and like their tone in my system.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Also enjoy the added bass over my previous mains (Focal Chora 826).","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I have them powered by the Class D Primare i32, so you might want to consider a Class D amp.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Not sure about the Yamaha but I guess it\u2019s adding it\u2019s own warmth.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Too much warmth is no good perhaps.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Also, depends on source and DAC (if applicable).","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Not the nicest setup in the world, but I am proud of it","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Pull those speakers out just past the cabinet- that should improve the sound.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I like your dog!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I previously had been using an Audio Technica LP60X turntable with some Polk bookshelf speakers, and a big boxy Onyo stereo receiver I got from a pawnshop.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The change to the Fluance turntable with the 2M Blue cart is ridiculous.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Every morning I throw on a record or two because I feel drawn to play them.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The JBl speakers have been nice too, although I do need to adjust the bass and treble on the amp a little to get it where I want it.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I hope to use this setup for years, but would love to know if there are any marginal (affordable) improvements I could make in the short-medium term?","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Nice setup.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Looks great and imagine it sounds good too.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"We've had three of those dogs over the last 35 years - one was totally crazy, one was the greatest, and the current one is bonkers but settling down nicely.","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"how do you like that bt20a?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Sweet little setup.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"My only advice is to move the whole shebang to the left, give the speakers a little more room to image\u2026play with toe-in, distance from wall, etc.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Then add a REL T-Zero.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"BOC - nice choice :)","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Nice sub-woofer","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Nice, clean setup.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Have you considered using taller stands to clear the cabinet?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Better sound dispersion that way, also the tweeters would be better aligned with your ears.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Love it!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Really nice, enjoy the music!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Very nice.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Better than mine.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Enjoy","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"New meta, get a dog for room treatment","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Any setup without a great honking ugly TV above it gets my vote.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"It looks fabulous.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Other than the good looking woofer in front, you may add a sub in the future just to help out in the lows.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Other than that, that\u2019s still a nice clean setup.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Beautiful dog too!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"And it's a clean space.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Best way to listen.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The woofer complements your system beautifly.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Add an Aiyima tube preamp and a Pioneer subwoofer and that's pretty much my setup downstairs.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Or at least pull them forward even with the front of the Cabinet.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Yah was going to say the same thing.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"Amen brother","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Thanks!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The PA10 pre-amp is quite good, although I know there are superior ones out there.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I ultimately chose it because I knew that Fluance would have made it sound great with one of their turntables, and can confirm that it works very nicely with the RT-85.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The credenza is the Besta series from Ikea!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I actually found them on marketplace!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The previous owner mentioned he got them from a local audio store at least 10 years earlier.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"They are wrought iron - very simple but quite sleek and stylish","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Ikea!","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"It\u2019s the Besta series, and we customized it heavily.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Congrats, enjoy!!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019m using the fluance PA10 pre-amp and I think it pairs nicely with the turntable, given that they are the same brand.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"You will need a pre-amp with this turntable.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Hahahaha - yep I am the one idiot out there shovelling by hand\u2026","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"You\u2019re a real one for knowing them!","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"You will notice the change though when you choose to upgrade","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Ours were\/are and this one sure looks like the exact same dog as one of ours so I\u2019d say yes!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"The nicest one of the Eskies that we had would get on really high countertops and tables and knock everything over - its ability to jump and climb was really something else.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"But it was so mellow and sweet too.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I'm still amazed how similar it looks to ours even if it isn't the same breed.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"That\u2019s awesome, I thinking about pulling the trigger on it.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"REL T-Zeo is very nice.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I too would suggest playing around with placement.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"But mostly, well done and happy listening!","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"I finally found a pair","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Great speakers!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I bought a used pair awhile back and was blown away by how gorgeous they sounded.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"One of them popped a tweeter and I took them to a speaker \u201cspecialist\u201d who had a replacement tweeter and offered to overhaul the crossover.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Biggest mistake of my audio life because they lost their magic \u2014 soundstage and that awesome resolution.","Sentiment":0}
{"Sentences":"Bottom line, unless the caps go bad don\u2019t mess with it.","Sentiment":0}

{"Sentences":"Should be super easy to swap out","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"Also remember to tighten the screws of your drive units on the back of the speakers.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"I just have a really old Logitech set\ud83d\uddff","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"first setup!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Move your turntable off the amp if you can.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"You don\u2019t want to cover up the vent.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I suspect the crux of the comments will be to get your turntable off the table and to isolate the speakers somehow.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Happy new years all!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I (17m) have been collecting records and some audio gear for a few months now, and am very proud of the setup I have.","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":"Nice!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"What are those ananda's running out of?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Anyway, nice setup!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"One heck of alot better than my first one!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Good call for a first turntable.","Sentiment":2}

{"Sentences":":)","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Thanks!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"they\u2019re running PC>Pioneer as soon as I can find a cable to aux that fits in the RCA ports on the receiver.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I guess they\u2019re much closer on the older machines as there was less insulation on the plugs","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Nice!","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I am going to my first set up for office so I\u2019m intrigued.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Do you have PC audio go through that amp?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"First setup since highschool","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Also, I\u2019m about $170 into this setup including parts for refurbishment","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"The AR turntable is the real gem - these have skyrocketed in price, alongside the renewed interest in vinyl.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"If you change the belt and keep everything in stock condition, you'll have a turntable that'll give excellent performance, and probably last for another 50 years.","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"Match it up with a vintage or modern high-compliance phono cartridge, and it'll be on par with any belt-drive below $1K.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"That's nice\n\n\/s sack the jazz though put on some slayer","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I refurbished a Madison Fields version of that amp.","Sentiment":1}

{"Sentences":"It works great as is , the belt was stored separately .","Sentiment":2}
{"Sentences":"I\u2019ll be getting a new belt soon, and will perform general maintenance despite its functionality soon.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"I run heavier stuff too.","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Earth, bardo pond , growing , calm \u2026 not slayer though","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"What model is the Madison fields version?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Just found out about it !","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"How do you like yours ?","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"How would you describe how it sounds .","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Yes I did notice the transformer had been swapped .. but not by me","Sentiment":1}
{"Sentences":"Sounds great - you're really going to enjoy it.","Sentiment":2}
