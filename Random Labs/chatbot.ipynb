from where streep\\'s great-great-grandfather, gottfried streeb, immigrated to the united states and where one of her ancestors served as mayor (the surname was later changed to \"streep\").',\n \" another line of her father's family was from giswil.\",\n 'her mother had english, german, and irish ancestry.',\n \" some of streep's maternal ancestors lived in pennsylvania and rhode island, and

that she liked to show off in front of the camera in family home movies from a young age.',\n ' at age 12, streep was selected to sing at a school recital, leading to her having opera lessons from estelle liebling.',\n 'despite her talent, she later remarked, \"i was singing something i didn\\'t feel and understand.',\n 'that was an important lessonâ€”not to do that.',\n 'to find the thing that i could feel through.',\n '\" she quit after four years.',\n 'streep had many catholic school friends, and regularly attended mass.',\n ' she was a high school cheerleader for the bernards high school

theater until acting in the play miss julie at vassar college in 1969, in which she gained attention across the campus.',\n ' vassar drama professor clinton j. atkinson noted, \"i don\\'t think anyone ever taught meryl acting.',\n 'she really taught herself.',\n '\" streep demonstrated an early ability to mimic accents and to quickly memorize her lines.',\n 'she received her ba in drama cum laude in 1971, before applying for an mfa from the yale school of drama.',\n 'at yale, she supplemented her course fees by working as a waitress and typist, and appeared in over a dozen stage productions

woman in a wheelchair in a comedy written by then-unknown playwrights christopher durang and albert innaurato.\",\n ' she was a student of choreographer carmen de lavallade, whom she introduced at the 2017 kennedy center honors.',\n ' another of her teachers was robert lewis, a co-founder of the actors studio.',\n 'streep disapproved of some of the acting exercises she was asked to do, remarking that one professor taught the emotional recall technique by delving into personal lives in a way she found \"obnoxious\".',\n ' she received her mfa in drama from yale in 1975.',\n ' she also enrolled as a visiting student at dartmouth college in 1970, and received an honorary doctor of arts degree from the college in 1981.',\n \"career 1970s: early work and breakthrough one of streep's first professional jobs in 1975 was at the eugene o'neill theater center's national playwrights conference, during which she acted in five plays over six weeks.\",\n 'she moved to new york city in 1975, and was cast by joseph papp in a production of trelawny of the wells at the vivian beaumont theater, opposite mandy patinkin and john lithgow.',\n \" she went on to appear in five more roles in her first year in new york, including in papp's new york shakespeare festival productions of henry v, the taming of the shrew with raul julia, and measure for measure opposite sam waterston and john cazale.\",\n ' she entered into a relationship with cazale at this time, and resided with him until his death three years later.',\n ' she starred in the musical happy end on broadway, and won an obie for her performance in the off-broadway play alice at the palace.',\n \"although streep had not aspired to become a film actor, robert de niro's performance in taxi driver (1976) had a profound impact on her; she said to herself, 'that's the kind of actor i want to be when i grow up.\",\n \"' streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in dino de laurentiis's king kong.\",\n 'de laurentiis, referring to streep as she stood before him, said in italian to his son: \"this is so ugly.',\n 'why did you bring me this?',\n '\" unknown to laurentiis, streep understood italian, and she remarked, \"i\\'m very sorry that i\\'m not as beautiful as i should be, but, you know â€“ this is it.',\n 'this is what you get.',\n '\" she continued

appeared off-broadway at the chelsea theater center.\",\n 'she received drama desk award nominations for both productions.',\n \"streep's first feature film role came opposite jane fonda in the 1977 film julia, in which she had a small role during a flashback sequence.\",\n 'most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress:i had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene i shot with jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene.',\n \"i thought, i've made a terrible mistake, no more movies.\",\n 'i hate this business.',\n 'however, streep stated in 2015 that fonda had a lasting influence on her as an actress, and credited her with opening \"probably more doors than i probably even know about\".',\n ' robert de niro, who had spotted streep in her stage production of the cherry orchard, suggested that she play the role of his girlfriend in the war film the deer hunter (1978).',\n ' was also cast in the film, and streep took on the role of a \"vague, stock girlfriend\" to remain with cazale for the duration of filming.',\n ' longworth notes that streep:made a case for female empowerment by playing a woman to whom empowerment was a foreign conceptâ€“a normal lady from an average american small town, for whom subservience was the only thing she knew.',\n 'pauline kael, who later became a strong critic of streep, remarked that she was a \"real beauty\" who brought much freshness to the film with her performance.',\n \" the film's success exposed streep to a wider audience and earned her a nomination for the academy award for best supporting actress.\",\n 'in the 1978 miniseries holocaust, streep played the leading role of a german woman married to a jewish artist played by james woods in nazi era germany.',\n 'she found the material to be \"unrelentingly noble\" and professed to have taken on the role for financial gain.',\n ' streep travelled to germany and austria for filming while cazale remained in new york.',\n \"upon her return, streep found that cazale's illness had progressed, and she nursed him until his death on march 12, 1978.\",\n ' with an estimated audience of 109 million, holocaust brought a wider degree of public recognition to streep, who found herself \"on the verge of national visibility\".',\n 'she won the primetime emmy award for outstanding lead actress in a miniseries or a movie for her performance.',\n ' despite the awards success, streep was still not enthusiastic towards her film career and preferred acting on stage.',\n 'she played the supporting role of leilah in wendy wasserstein\\'s uncommon women and others in a may 1978 \"theater in america\" television production for pbs\\'s great performances.',\n ' she replaced glenn close, who played the role in the off-broadway production at the phoenix theatre.',\n ' streep in 1977 hoping to divert herself from the grief of cazale\\'s death, streep accepted a role in the seduction of joe tynan (1979) as the chirpy love interest of alan alda, later commenting that she played it on \"automatic pilot\".',\n 'she performed the role of katherine in the taming of the shrew for shakespeare in the park, and also played a supporting role in manhattan (1979) for woody allen.',\n 'streep later said that allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes, and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue.',\n 'in the drama kramer vs. kramer, streep was cast opposite dustin hoffman as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child.',\n 'streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as \"too evil\" and insisted that it was not representative of real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles.',\n 'the makers agreed with her, and the script was revised.',\n ' and frequented the upper east side neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions between parents and children.',\n ' the director robert benton allowed streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from hoffman, who \"hated her guts\" at first.',\n ' hoffman and producer stanley r. jaffe later spoke of streep\\'s tirelessness, with hoffman commenting: \"she\\'s extraordinarily hard-working, to the extent that she\\'s obsessive.',\n \"i think that she thinks about nothing else, but what she's doing.\",\n '\" the film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic stephen farber believed displayed streep\\'s \"own emotional intensity\", writing that she was one of the \"rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery\".',\n \"for kramer vs. kramer, streep won both the golden globe award and the academy award for best supporting actress, which she famously left in the ladies' room after giving her speech.\",\n ' national board of review award for best supporting actress and national society of film critics award for best supporting actress for her collective work in her three film releases of 1979.',\n ' both the deer hunter and kramer vs. kramer were major commercial successes and were consecutive winners of the academy award for best picture.',\n \"1980s: rise to prominence in 1979, streep began workshopping alice in concert, a musical version of alice's adventures in wonderland, with writer and composer elizabeth swados and director joseph papp; the show was put on at new york's public theater from december 1980.\",\n 'frank rich of the new york times referred to streep as the production\\'s \"one wonder\", but questioned why she devoted so much energy to it.',\n ' by 1980, streep had progressed to leading roles in films.',\n 'she was featured on the cover of newsweek magazine with the headline \"a star for the 80s\"; jack kroll commented, \"there\\'s a sense of mystery in her acting; she doesn\\'t simply imitate (although she\\'s a great mimic in private).',\n 'she transmits a sense of danger, a primal unease lying just below the surface of normal behavior\".',\n 'streep denounced her fervent media coverage at the time as \"excessive hype\".',\n \" the story within a story drama the french lieutenant's woman (1981) was streep's first leading role.\",\n 'the film paired streep with jeremy irons as contemporary actors, telling their modern story, as well as the victorian era drama they were performing.',\n 'streep developed an english accent for the part, but considered herself a misfit for the role: \"i couldn\\'t help wishing that i was more beautiful\".',\n ' a new york magazine article commented that, while many female stars of the past had cultivated a singular identity in their films, streep was a \"chameleon\", willing to play any type of role.',\n ' streep was awarded a bafta award for best actress in a leading role for her work.',\n ' the following year, she re-united with robert benton for the psychological thriller, still of the night (1982), co-starring roy scheider and jessica tandy.',\n 'vincent canby, writing for the new york times, noted that the film was an homage to the works of alfred hitchcock, but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between streep and scheider, concluding that streep \"is stunning, but she\\'s not on screen anywhere near long enough\".',\n \"greater success came later in the year when streep starred in the drama sophie's choice (also 1982), portraying a polish survivor of auschwitz caught in a love triangle between a young naÃ¯ve writer (peter macnicol) and a jewish intellectual (kevin kline).\",\n \"streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a polish accent drew praise.\",\n ' william styron wrote the novel with ursula andress in mind for the role of sophie, but streep was determined to get the role.',\n ' streep filmed the \"choice\" scene in one take and refused to do it again, finding it extremely painful and emotionally exhausting.',\n ' that scene, in which streep is ordered by an ss guard at auschwitz to choose which of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp, is her most famous scene, according to emma brockes of the guardian who wrote in 2006: \"it\\'s classic streep, the kind of scene that makes your scalp tighten, but defter in a way is her handling of smaller, harder-to-grasp emotions\".',\n 'among several acting awards, streep won the academy award for best actress for her performance, and her characterization was voted the third greatest movie performance of all time by premiere magazine.',\n ' roger ebert said of her delivery, \"streep plays the brooklyn scenes with an enchanting polish-american accent (she has the first accent i\\'ve ever wanted to hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled german and polish.',\n \"there is hardly an emotion that streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining.\",\n 'this is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances i can imagine\".',\n ' pauline kael, on the contrary, called the film an \"infuriatingly bad movie\", and thought that streep \"decorporealizes\" herself, which she believed explained why her movie heroines \"don\\'t seem to be full characters, and why there are no incidental joys to be had from watching her\".',\n \"in 1983, streep played her first non-fictional character, the nuclear whistleblower and labor union activist karen silkwood, who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the kerr-mcgee plutonium plant, in mike nichols' biographical film silkwood.\",\n 'streep felt a personal connection to silkwood, and in preparation, she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality.',\n ' she said, \"i didn\\'t try to turn myself into karen.',\n 'i just tried to look at what she did.',\n 'i put together every piece of information i could find about her ... what i finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside\".',\n ' jack kroll of newsweek considered streep\\'s characterization to have been \"brilliant\", while silkwood\\'s boyfriend drew stephens expressed approval in that streep had played karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite karen\\'s father bill thinking that streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down.',\n 'pauline kael believed that streep had been miscast.',\n 'streep next played opposite robert de niro in the romance falling in love (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the french resistance during world war ii in the british drama plenty (1985), adapted from the play by david hare.',\n 'for the latter, roger ebert wrote that she conveyed \"great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm ... streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms.',\n '\" in 2008, molly haskell praised streep\\'s performance in plenty, believing it to be \"one of streep\\'s most difficult and ambiguous\" films and \"most feminist\" role.',\n \"longworth considers streep's next release, out of africa (1985), to have established her as a hollywood superstar.\",\n \"in the film, streep starred as the danish writer karen blixen, opposite robert redford's denys finch hatton.\",\n 'director sydney pollack was initially dubious about streep in the role, as he did not think she was sexy enough, and had considered jane seymour for the part.',\n 'pollack recalls that streep impressed him in a different way: \"she was so direct, so honest, so without bullshit.',\n 'there was no shielding between her and me.',\n '\" streep and pollack often clashed during the 101-day shoot in kenya, particularly over blixen\\'s voice.',\n 'streep had spent much time listening to tapes of blixen, and began speaking in an old-fashioned and aristocratic fashion, which pollack thought excessive.',\n ' a significant commercial success, the film won a golden globe for best picture.',\n ' it also earned streep another academy award nomination for best actress, and the film ultimately won best picture.',\n 'film critic stanley kauffmann praised her performance, writing \"meryl streep is back in top form.',\n 'this means her performance in out of africa is at the highest level of acting in film today.',\n '\" streep in 1989 longworth notes that the dramatic success of out of africa led to a backlash of critical opinion against streep in the years that followed, especially as she was now demanding $4 million a picture.',\n 'unlike other stars at the time, such as sylvester stallone and tom cruise, streep \"never seemed to play herself\", and certain critics felt her technical finesse led people to literally see her acting.',\n ' her next films did not appeal to a wide audience; she co-starred with jack nicholson in the dramas heartburn (1986) and ironweed (1987), in which she sang onscreen for the first time since the \"great performances\" telecast of the phoenix theater production of secret service (1977).',\n 'in evil angels (1988), she played lindy chamberlain, an australian woman who had been convicted of the murder of her infant daughter despite claiming that the baby had been taken by a dingo.',\n 'filmed in australia, streep won the australian film institute award for best actress in a leading role, a best actress at the cannes film festival, and the new york film critics circle award for best actress.',\n \", so it's like coming from italian to spanish.\",\n 'you get a little mixed up.',\n '\" vincent canby of the new york times referred to her performance as \"another stunning performance\", played with \"the kind of virtuosity that seems to re-define the possibilities of screen acting\".',\n 'in 1989, streep lobbied to play the lead role in oliver stone\\'s adaption of the play evita, but two months before filming was due to commence, she dropped out, citing \"exhaustion\" initially, although it was later revealed that there was a dispute over her salary.',\n ' by the end of the decade, streep actively looked to star in a comedy.',\n 'she found the role in she-devil (1989), a satire that parodied societal obsession with beauty and cosmetic surgery, in which she played a glamorous writer.',\n ' though the film was not a success, richard corliss of time wrote that streep was the \"one reason\" to see it, and observed that it marked a departure from the dramatic roles she was known to play.',\n ' reacting to her string of poorly received films, streep said: \"audiences are shrinking; as the marketing strategy defines more and more narrowly who they want to reach males from 16 to 25 â€“ it\\'s become a chicken-and-egg syndrome.',\n 'which came first?',\n \"first, they release all these summer movies, then do a demographic survey of who's going to see them.\",\n '\"1990s: commercial fluctuations biographer karen hollinger described the early 1990s as a downturn in the popularity of streep\\'s films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious, but commercially unsuccessful, dramas, and, more significantly, to the lack of options available to an actress in her forties.',\n ' a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, \"by the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one\\'s interested in her anymore.',\n \"and if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care.\",\n '\" at the screen actor\\'s guild national women\\'s conference in 1990, streep keynoted the first national event, emphasizing the decline in women\\'s work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry.',\n ' she criticized the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.',\n ' streep at the 32nd grammy awards in 1990 after roles in the comedy-drama postcards from the edge (1990), and the comedy-fantasy defending your life (1991), streep starred with goldie hawn in the farcical black comedy, death becomes her (1992), with bruce willis as their co-star.',\n 'streep persuaded writer david koepp to re-write several of the scenes, particularly the one in which her character has an affair with a younger man, which she believed was \"unrealistically male\" in its conception.',\n 'the seven-month shoot was the longest of streep\\'s career, during which she got into character by \"thinking about being slightly pissed off all of the time\".',\n \" due to streep's allergies to numerous cosmetics, special prosthetics had to be designed to age her by ten years to look 54, although streep believed that they made her look nearer 70.\",\n ' longworth considers death becomes her to have been \"the most physical performance streep had yet committed to screen, all broad weeping, smirking, and eye-rolling\".',\n \" although it was a commercial success, earning $15.1 million in just five days, streep's contribution to comedy was generally not taken well by critics.\",\n ' time\\'s richard corliss wrote approvingly of streep\\'s \"wicked-witch routine\" but dismissed the film as \"she-devil with a make-over\" and one which \"hates women\".',\n ' streep later admitted to having disliked filming the scenes involving heavy special effects, and vowed never to work again on a film with heavy special effects.',\n \"streep appeared with jeremy irons, glenn close and winona ryder in the house of the

them, rather than personifying them\".',\n 'in her early roles such as manhattan and kramer vs. kramer, she was compared to both diane keaton and jill clayburgh, in that her characters were unsympathetic, which streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy.',\n ' streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, \"i come ready and i don\\'t want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable\".',\n 'mike nichols, who directed streep in silkwood, heartburn, postcards from the edge, and angels in america, praised streep\\'s ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, \"in every role, she becomes a totally new human being.',\n 'as she becomes the person she is portraying, the other performers begin to react to her as if she were that person.',\n '\" he said that directing her is \"so much like falling in love that it has the characteristics of a time which you remember as magical, but which is shrouded in mystery\".',\n ' he also noted that streep\\'s acting ability had a profound impact on her co-stars, and that \"one could improve by 1000% purely by watching her\".',\n ' longworth believes that in nearly every film, streep has \"sly infused\" a feminist point of view in her portrayals.',\n ' however, film critic molly haskell has stated, \"none of her heroines are feminist, strictly speaking.',\n 'yet, they uncannily embody various crosscurrents of experience in the last twenty years, as women have re-defined themselves against the background of the women\\'s movement\".',\n \" streep's star on the hollywood walk of fame streep is well known for her ability to imitate a wide range of accents â€“ from danish in out of africa (1985) to british received pronunciation in the french lieutenant's
